## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![MechaCar MPG](https://github.com/jkannis/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Deliverable1.png)

In evaluating car traits to determine which ones contribute to MPG, this statistical analysis shows that vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and all-wheel-drive provide non-random amounts of variance to the MPG values. The slope of this linear model is not considered to be zero because of the wide variance of p-value results. This linear model does not effectively predict MPG because there are variables included that do not have a consistent impact on MPG.
